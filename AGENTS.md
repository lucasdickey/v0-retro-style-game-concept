# Repository Agent Guidelines

## Commit and Pull Request Instructions
- Use clear, concise commit messages describing the change.
- After modifying code, run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` to verify the project compiles and passes lint checks.
- Include a short description of what was changed in the PR body.

## Coding Conventions
- TypeScript is used throughout the project. Prefer `.tsx` for React components and `.ts` for other files.
- Keep line length under 120 characters where possible.
- Use existing formatting and rely on the project lint configuration.

## File Scope
These guidelines apply to the entire repository.
